# Contributing Guideline
This documentation will define how to contribute `robe-react-ui`. If you believe this documentation should be developed please open an issue.

## Opening issues
Feel free to suggest new components, replacing the old ones or changing the props for easier usage or reporting bugs. You can open issue for everything but please be sure that it is not duplicated and explained well. 

## Testing
The UX is important, you can always test the usage of the components and give advice according to their behaviour.

## Coding
Pick an issue and create a pull request. Every issue is available for everyone. If it is not clear, request for more information and then we can discuss the issue to explain it better.

## Clean Code & Clean Coder
Sometimes we get confused with namings of components, props or methods, please do not hesitate to review/refactor our sources and create a pull request to make them understandable.

## Documentation
It is important we know. Generally, samples and docs are enough for us but not for an outsider. We can call it project blindness, a pair of brand new eyes will be more objective about them. Feel free to request or write docs.
